### Results

Explore the visualizations and analyses on the [GovDataAnalysis Platform](https://govdataanalysis.streamlit.app/),, though note that due to Streamlit's limitations, queries may be slower; for faster performance, running the [notebook](https://github.com/ChrystianMelo/GovDataAnalysis/blob/main/Project.ipynb) independently is recommended.
